# HYPE üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: SingleThreaded


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sidharth Manikuttan

### Project Description
The "Hyper Yielding Positivity Engine (HYPE)" is a face recognition-based HYPE machine that identifies a person, displays exaggerated or humorous "credentials," plays a preset motivational audio message, and sends a super-charged, uplifting email to their inbox. It's designed to boost morale with a fun, over-the-top twist!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world overflowing with mediocrity, individuals suffer from a crippling lack of motivation and recognition, leading to an epidemic of uninspired vibes and bland encouragement. People are frequently bombarded with mundane affirmations that fail to ignite their passion or creativity. This alarming trend results in a widespread deficit of excitement and joy, leaving everyone trapped in a monotonous loop of underachievement. Our society is in desperate need of a jolt of enthusiasm to break the cycle and bring back the thrill of over-the-top RECOGNITION and motivation that everyone truly deserves!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the "HYPE" ‚Äì a groundbreaking, utterly unnecessary solution to the non-existent problem of lackluster motivation! Our system harnesses the power of face recognition technology to identify individuals and then celebrates their presence with a flurry of absurdly exaggerated accolades and amusing credentials. As if that weren‚Äôt enough, it delivers a rousing audio announcement that turns every entrance into an award ceremony, complete with motivational speeches fit for that person. To top it all off, it sends out a preset outrageously enthusiastic email that celebrates your uniqueness and prowess, whether you're a master chef, an aspiring Engineer, or just someone who successfully made it out of bed that day. The HYPE is here to save the day ‚Äì or at least provide a good chuckle!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used : Python
- Frameworks used : Firebase Realtime Database (for data storage and retrieval)
- Libraries used : OpenCV (cv2) for video capture and image processing,
Face Recognition for facial detection and recognition (Anaconda),
NumPy for numerical operations,
CVZone for additional OpenCV utilities,
Pyttsx3 for text-to-speech functionality,
Smtplib for sending emails,
Email.mime for constructing email messages,
Pickle for serialization of encoded face data
- Tools used : Visual Studio Code for coding and debugging,
Firebase Console for database management,
A webcam for capturing video input

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
- git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/Sidharth-Manikuttan/Useless_Project-HYPE.git)
- Create a new Anaconda environment (optional but recommended)
- conda install -c conda-forge opencv (If using Anaconda)/ pip install opencv-python
- conda install -c conda-forge face_recognition/ pip install face_recognition
- pip install numpy
- pip install pyttsx3
- pip install firebase-admin

# Run
- python <AddDataToDatabase.py> (Add new data to the database)
- python <EncodeGenerator.py> (Encode the images to be recognized)
- python <main.py>
